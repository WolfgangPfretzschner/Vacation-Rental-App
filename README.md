# Vacation Rental App 

* [Live](https://evernote-3a9c9.firebaseapp.com/) 



Inspired by AirBnb and my previouse vacation rental business in Florida. I wanted to start working on a basic app where guests can make a reservation if a property is available. The guest needs to create an account with email or facebook in order to be able to create a booking.

The HTML is styled with semantics, App uses react framework and the backend uses Google Firebase.
